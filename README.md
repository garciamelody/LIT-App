# Rainbow Reads
Using MongoDB to store books and EJS the user can add a book with an LGBTQA+ theme and like what other users have added.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js and MongoDB.

In this project, I used node.js and EJS to access and render HTML. I used MongoDB to store documents of books that the user want to share with the community. This app focuses on representing and supporting LGBTQA+ authors and stories.  

## Optimizations:
(optional)

Having more time I would love to implement a better UI to display the books and authors name differently and probably add links to buy the book and support the authors.

## Lessons Learned:

While working with EJS, I learned how easy is to format JS with HTML since the syntax is similar. I included "liked" as an Update method and a simple UI to scroll through the list of books.  

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
